# Migration

This section guides you through migrating NethVoice from NethServer 7 to NethServer 8, ensuring a smooth transition with minimal downtime.

## Overview {#overview}

The migration process involves three main phases:

1. **Prerequisites** - Verify system requirements, network connectivity, and prepare your data
2. **Start Migration** - Install migration tools, connect systems, and transfer data
3. **Post-Migration** - Verify functionality, finalize configuration, and optimize performance

Each phase includes detailed steps, troubleshooting guides, and verification checklists to ensure a successful transition.
