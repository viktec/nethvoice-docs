# Prerequisites

Before starting the NethVoice migration from NethServer 7 to NethServer 8, ensure all prerequisites are met. Proper preparation is essential for a smooth migration process.

## System Requirements {#system-requirements}

### Source System (NethServer 7) {#source-system-nethserver-7}

Your NethServer 7 system must meet the following requirements:

- **SSH Access**: Root or administrative SSH access to the NS7 server
- **Cockpit Access**: Web interface access via Cockpit (typically on port 9090)
- **NethVoice Operational**: Current NethVoice installation must be running and operational
- **Migration Tool**: Ability to install "Migration to NS8" module from Software Center
- **System Updates**: NS7 should be fully updated before starting migration

### Destination System (NethServer 8) {#destination-system-nethserver-8}

The destination NS8 system requires:

- **Fresh Installation**: A freshly installed NS8 cluster (see [NS8 Installation guide](/docs/administrator-manual/install/nethserver))
- **Adequate Resources**: Sufficient CPU, RAM, and disk space to accommodate NethVoice and its data
  - Minimum: 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 100GB disk space
  - Recommended: Scale based on your NS7 usage and data volume
- **NethVoice Proxy**: Should be pre-installed and configured (see [NethVoice Proxy documentation](/docs/administrator-manual/advanced/nethvoice_proxy.md))
  - Note: If not installed, the migration tool will install it automatically, but manual configuration will be required afterward
- **Supported VoIP trunks and phones**: Ensure that all VoIP trunks and phones used in NS7 are supported in NS8. Check the [Supported Phones](/docs/administrator-manual/provisioning/supported_phones.md), [Supported Gateways](/docs/administrator-manual/provisioning/supported_gateways.md) and [Supported trunks](/docs/administrator-manual/provisioning/supported_trunks.md) documentation for compatibility information.

:::tip Pre-install NethVoice Proxy
It's highly recommended to install and configure NethVoice Proxy **before** starting the migration. This ensures proper network configuration and reduces post-migration tasks.
:::

## Network Requirements {#network-requirements}

### VPN Connectivity {#vpn-connectivity}

The NS8 cluster uses a VPN for secure communication between nodes and during migration:

- **VPN Address Resolution**: The NS8 cluster VPN address must be resolvable from NS7
  - The VPN address is configured during cluster creation
  - By default, this is the leader node FQDN
- **VPN Port Access**: Default VPN port **55820** must not be blocked by:
  - Firewalls on NS7 or NS8
  - Intermediate network appliances
  - Router ACLs between NS7 and NS8
- **Network Testing**: Verify connectivity before starting migration:
  ```bash
  # From NS7, test VPN port connectivity
  nc -zv <ns8-leader-fqdn> 55820
  ```

### DNS Requirements {#dns-requirements}

Proper DNS configuration is critical for NethVoice migration:

- **DNS Server Access**: You must have administrative access to your authoritative DNS server
- **DNS Record Management**: Ability to create and modify DNS records

#### FQDNs Required for NethVoice {#fqdns-required-for-nethvoice}

You need to plan and prepare **two separate FQDNs**:

| FQDN Purpose | Example | Description |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| **NethVoice Administration** | `nethvoice.example.com` | Access to NethVoice administration interface. You can use this FQDN also for the proxy if your are going to install only one NethVoice instance. |
| **NethVoice CTI** | `cti.example.com` | Access to NethVoice CTI web application |

:::warning FQDN Planning
Plan these FQDNs carefully before starting migration. You'll need to provide them during the migration process, and DNS records must be updated after migration completes.
:::

If you are consolidating multiple NethVoice instances behind a single proxy, you will need also to plan an additional FQDN for the proxy itself, like `proxy.example.com`.

#### DNS Record Types {#dns-record-types}

You'll need to create or update:
- **A Records**: Pointing to the NS8 node IP address
- **CNAME Records** (optional): If using aliases

#### DNS Propagation {#dns-propagation}

- Allow 24-48 hours for DNS propagation after updating records
- Consider using low TTL values before migration to speed up propagation
- Test DNS resolution from multiple locations after updating

## Account Provider Prerequisites {#account-provider-prerequisites}

Account provider configuration depends on your current NS7 setup.

### Local Account Provider (OpenLDAP or Samba AD) {#local-account-provider-openldap-or-samba-ad}

If NS7 uses a local account provider:

#### OpenLDAP {#openldap}
- **Domain Name**: Choose a unique domain name for the NS8 cluster
- **Renaming Allowed**: The domain can be renamed during the connection process
- **No Conflicts**: Ensure the chosen name doesn't conflict with existing NS8 domains

#### Active Directory (Samba) {#active-directory-samba}
- **Domain Name Fixed**: AD domain names cannot be changed during migration
- **Pre-check Required**: Verify your AD domain name doesn't conflict with existing NS8 domains
- **Unique Name**: The domain name must be unique within the NS8 cluster

:::info Temporary External Domain
During migration, a temporary external user domain is created in NS8 to allow migrated applications to access the NS7 account provider. This is automatically removed once the account provider migration completes.
:::

### Remote Account Provider {#remote-account-provider}

If NS7 uses a remote account provider (external LDAP/AD):

1. **Matching Configuration Required**: NS8 must have an external user domain configured that matches your NS7 setup
2. **BaseDN Matching**: The NS8 external domain must match the NS7 BaseDN
   
   **Example**:
   - NS7 BaseDN: `dc=directory,dc=nh`
   - NS8 domain name must be: `directory.nh`

3. **Same LDAP Database**: The NS8 external user domain must point to the same LDAP database as NS7
4. **Cluster-wide Access**: All nodes in the NS8 cluster must be able to reach the LDAP database
5. **Future Accessibility**: Ensure the LDAP database will remain accessible after NS7 decommission

:::warning External Provider Setup
Configure the external user domain in NS8 **before** starting the migration. Refer to the [Account Provider Configuration](https://docs.nethserver.org/projects/ns8/en/latest/user_domains.html) guide.
:::

## Data Preparation {#data-preparation}

### Backup Strategy {#backup-strategy}

**Create a complete backup before migration**:

Use NS7 backup module or your preferred backup solution to execute a full system backup.

:::warning Backup is Mandatory
Never proceed with migration without a complete, verified backup. Test your backup restoration procedure before starting.
:::

### Resource Planning {#resource-planning}

Estimate the resources needed for migration:

#### Disk Space Calculation {#disk-space-calculation}

Calculate required disk space on NS8:

| Data Type | Location on NS7 | Typical Size |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Call Recordings** | `/var/spool/asterisk/monitor/` | Varies (can be 10GB - 500GB+) |
| **Audio Files** | `/var/lib/asterisk/sounds/custom/` | 100MB - 1GB |
| **CDR Database** | MySQL database | 500MB - 10GB+ |
| **Voicemail** | `/var/spool/asterisk/voicemail/` | 1GB - 20GB+ |
| **Configuration** | Various | < 100MB |

Check your actual usage:
```bash
# On NS7, check recording size
du -sh /var/spool/asterisk/monitor/

# Check voicemail size
du -sh /var/spool/asterisk/voicemail/

# Check CDR database size
mysql -e "SELECT table_schema AS 'Database', 
ROUND(SUM(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS 'Size (MB)' 
FROM information_schema.TABLES 
WHERE table_schema = 'asteriskcdrdb' 
GROUP BY table_schema;"
```

#### Network and Time Planning {#network-and-time-planning}

- **Network Bandwidth**: Higher bandwidth reduces sync time
- **Initial Sync**: Can take several hours depending on data volume
- **Incremental Syncs**: Subsequent syncs are faster (only changes)
- **Final Cutover**: Plan 30 minutes to 2 hours downtime for final migration

:::tip Minimize Downtime
Perform multiple data synchronizations before the final cutover. This minimizes the final downtime window as only changed data needs to be transferred.
:::
