The choice between a **Cloud (IaaS/SaaS)** and an **On-Premise** (local) installation of NethVoice on NethServer largely depends on business requirements, available IT resources, and specific needs related to control, security, and scalability.

NethVoice cannot be accessed using an IP address — clients (IP phones, mobile apps, CTI integrations, and NethLink) must be always configured to use the **publicly resolvable FQDN**.

This is a fundamental change from previous versions (e.g., NethVoice 14) and is mandated by modern best practices for **Security** (enabling valid SSL/TLS certificates) and **Maintainability** (simplified centralized management). A publicly resolvable FQDN is a non-negotiable prerequisite.


### Option 1: Cloud Deployment (IaaS or SaaS)

This option involves hosting NethServer and NethVoice with a Cloud Provider (IaaS) or utilizing a pre-configured SaaS solution.

#### Key Advantages

* **Provider Certification**: In general, it is always recommended to choose certified provider that fully integrate with the NethVoice proxy to avoid potential connection and registration issues.
* **Native Firewall Management**: The firewall component is managed natively by NethServer within the cloud environment.
* **Consolidation**: Multiple small PBX systems can be efficiently consolidated into a single NethServer node.
* **Simplified Migration**: When Media gateways are not involved, direct migration from existing hardware is possible, reducing switchover times.

The NethVoice proxy (Kamailio/RTP Engine) strictly follows SIP standards and includes additional hardening measures to improve security. The proxy acts as a SIP/TLS termination point and media relay, enforcing SIP best practices (strict parsing, authentication, ACLs, rate‑limiting, TLS/SRTP where applicable) to reduce attack surface and improve resilience.

The proxy isolates and mediates external signaling and media, along with the firewall, it avoids direct exposure of the Asterisk by improving security.

#### What do you need?

* **FQDN** → pointing to the public IP for the **NethVoice proxy**
* **FQDN** → pointing to the public IP for **NethVoice**
* **FQDN** → pointing to the public IP for **NethVoice CTI**
* Dedicated **public IP** with required ports open refer to: [firewall configuration](../administrator-manual/configuration/firewall#port-summary)
* Valid SSL certificate for any FQDN (e.g., via Let’s Encrypt)


### Option 2: On-Premise Deployment with Public Access

The On-Premise installation involves hosting NethServer and NethVoice on the company's own physical servers or as a virtual machine (VM) within the local network infrastructure.

#### Key Challenges and Considerations

* **Firewall Management**: The client is responsible for configuring and managing the firewall (router/edge device).
* **FQDN / SSL Mandate**: A public FQDN is still mandatory. Features like NethLink and the Mobile App require public FQDN, SSL, and external reachability on specific ports.
* **Networking and Audio Issues**: Audio problems (e.g., one-way audio) in on-premise deployments are often caused by NAT configuration issues. For troubleshooting steps, refer to: [troubleshooting guide](./troubleshooting/audio_problems.md).
* **Networking Complexity**: Requires Hairpin NAT and careful firewall configuration to allow local clients to access the server via its public FQDN. As an alternative, Split DNS can be configured to resolve the FQDN to a local IP address for internal clients.

#### What do you need?

* **FQDN** → pointing to the public IP for the **NethVoice proxy**
* **FQDN** → pointing to the public IP for **NethVoice**
* **FQDN** → pointing to the public IP for **NethVoice CTI**
* Dedicated **public IP** and port forwarding refer to  the [firewall configuration](../administrator-manual/configuration/firewall#port-summary)
* Valid SSL certificate for any FQDN (e.g., via Let’s Encrypt)
* Split DNS (recommended) OR Public DNS only + **Hairpin NAT** properly configured refer to the [firewall configuration](../administrator-manual/configuration/firewall#hairpin-nat)

### Option 3: On-Premise Deployment without Public Access

This setup keeps NethVoice entirely **within the local network**, without exposing services externally.

#### What do you need?

* **FQDN** → pointing to the local IP for the **NethVoice proxy**
* **FQDN** → pointing to the local IP for **NethVoice**
* **FQDN** → pointing to the local IP for **NethVoice CTI**
* Valid SSL certificate for any FQDN (Let’s Encrypt cannot be used with standard HTTP/HTTPS validation in this scenario. DNS-based validation may be possible currently under evaluation, contact Nethesis support for more details)

| Feature | ☁️ Cloud Installation (IaaS/SaaS) | 🖥️ Public On-Premise Installation | 🖥️  Local On-Premise Installation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Access Method** | FQDN only (Mandatory). | FQDN only (Mandatory). | FQDN only (Mandatory). |
| **Firewall Management** | **Managed natively by NethServer** (Simpler). | **Managed by the client** (Requires expertise). | Not needed |
| **Proxy Use** | **Recommended** (Choose certified providers). | Recommended to avoid NAT/audio issues. | Recommended to have secure TLS connection |
| **Migration** | Direct migration possible; reduced switchover time. | Requires traditional migration/switchover process. | Requires traditional migration/switchover process. |
| **Network Complexity** | Low: Single FQDN, no Hairpin NAT needed for clients. | High: Requires Hairpin NAT and/or Split DNS setup. | Low but certificate is needed |

Given the architectural benefits for networking, security, and the significant operational advantages like native firewall and simplified migration, the **Cloud Deployment** is the recommended choice for a robust and simplified NethVoice solution.
