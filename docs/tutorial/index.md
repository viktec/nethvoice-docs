# Getting Started with NethVoice

NethVoice is a telephony and unified communications platform that provides PBX features for small and medium businesses.  
It offers call routing, voicemail, conferencing, and user management through an intuitive web interface.  
Designed to run on [NethServer](https://www.nethserver.org/), NethVoice supports scalable deployments and secure remote access via the NethVoice Proxy.

This guide will walk you through the basic steps to set up NethVoice on your system.

## 1. Install NethServer 8 {#install-nethserver-8}

Begin by installing NethServer 8 on your server.  
- Download and follow the installation instructions from the [official guide](https://docs.nethserver.org/projects/ns8/en/latest/install.html).
- After installation, access the web interface at `https://<server_ip_or_fqdn>/cluster-admin/` using:
  - **Username:** `admin`
  - **Password:** `Nethesis,1234`
- Create a cluster and ensure your server has a static IP address and a valid FQDN.
