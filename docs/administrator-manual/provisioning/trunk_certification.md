# Trunk Certification

## VoIP Provider Certification Procedure

Certifying a new VoIP provider means adding it to the NethVoice wizard as part of the list of automatically configured providers. Once certified, users only need to enter authentication credentials to configure the entire trunk.

### Certification Benefits

Certified and supported providers are strongly recommended to customers who want to take advantage of automatic configuration and guaranteed support. The certification process ensures providers meet NethVoice compatibility and quality standards.

### Support Levels

- **Certified providers**: Full support is available with guaranteed response times and technical assistance from Nethesis.
- **Non-certified SIP providers**: Limited support is provided. Support is limited to issue analysis, and resolution times may be longer depending on the nature of the problem.

## Certification Requirements

To complete the certification process and have a provider added to the certified providers list, the following requirements must be met:

### 1. Technical Contact

Identify a dedicated technical contact from the VoIP provider. This contact must:

- Remain the same throughout the certification process and after completion
- Be available for communication regarding any modifications required by the provider
- Be responsible for coordinating technical discussions with Nethesis support

### 2. Test Trunk

Obtain a test trunk from the provider to be installed on a test machine. This trunk will be used to:

- Verify provider configuration in NethVoice
- Conduct compatibility testing
- Validate call routing and features

### 3. Nethesis Testing

Nethesis support will conduct a series of comprehensive tests, including:

- Basic connectivity and registration verification
- Call establishment and termination testing
- Feature compatibility testing
- Performance and reliability validation
- Configuration template verification

### 4. Certification and Distribution

If all tests pass successfully:

- The provider will be added to the list of certified providers
- It will become available in the NethVoice configuration wizard
- The new provider will be distributed with the next NethVoice application update
