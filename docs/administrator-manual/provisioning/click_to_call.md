# Click to Call

## Overview {#overview}

**Click-to-Call** is a powerful feature that enables users to initiate phone calls by simply clicking on a phone number displayed in applications, web pages, or customer data sources. This eliminates the need to manually dial numbers and streamlines the call initiation process.

When a user clicks on a phone number, NethVoice automatically identifies the device and routes the call through the appropriate phone system:

- **Web Phone users** → Direct call via NethVoice CTI interface
- **Desktop users** → Call via NethLink desktop application  
- **Physical phone users** → Call directed to their configured desk phone

:::info Key Benefit
Click-to-Call dramatically improves user efficiency by reducing the steps needed to make a call. Instead of copying a number and manually dialing it, users simply click and connect.
:::

## Supported Scenarios {#supported-scenarios}

Click-to-Call works in three different configurations depending on the user's phone device:

| Scenario | Device Type | Setup Required | Best For |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Web Phone** | Browser-based | NethVoice CTI only | Remote workers, flexible locations |
| **Desktop Client** | NethLink + Physical phone | NethLink + Phone | Office workers with desk phones |
| **Physical Phone** | Provisioned SIP phone | NethLink + Phone provisioning | Standard office deployments |

## 3. Physical Phone (Desk Phone) {#3-physical-phone-desk-phone}

### What It Is {#what-it-is-2}

For users with **provisioned physical phones** (desk phones configured through NethVoice provisioning), Click-to-Call works through **NethLink** to send the call to your physical phone.

### How It Works {#how-it-works-2}

When you click a phone number:
1. NethLink detects the `tel:` protocol
2. NethLink sends call initiation to NethVoice
3. NethVoice routes the call to your **physical phone**
4. Your desk phone rings
5. You answer the call on your physical phone

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites-1}

For physical phone Click-to-Call, you need:

1. **NethVoice CTI access** with active user account
2. **Physical phone provisioned** in NethVoice (registered with MAC address)
3. **Physical phone assigned to your user** in NethVoice
4. **NethLink installed and configured** on your desktop
5. **Your physical phone on same network** OR **accessible via VPN**
6. **Network connectivity** between your computer and phone

### Network Requirements {#network-requirements}

The most important requirement is **network connectivity between your computer and physical phone**:

- ✅ **Same LAN** - Direct network connection
- ✅ **Connected VPN** - Remote office connected via VPN
- ✅ **Direct IP path** - Networks with routing configured
- ❌ **Internet only** - Phone on internet, computer on different network (will NOT work)

:::warning Network Dependency
Click-to-Call to physical phones requires direct network communication. If you're working remotely and your phone is in the office without VPN access, this scenario won't work.
