# Phonebook sources

The NethVoice phonebook is a centralized directory that stores and manages contact information for users and organizations. It enables seamless name and number resolution for incoming and outgoing calls, ensuring that caller details are consistently available across NethVoice CTI and NethVoice App. The phonebook can aggregate contacts from various sources, including external databases and CSV files, providing a unified and easily accessible address book for all users.

#### How phonebook sources interact with CTI permissions {#how-phonebook-sources-interact-with-cti-permissions}

Contacts imported from Address Book Sources are added to the centralized phonebook and are available for search and name resolution in NethVoice CTI and NethVoice App.

- Users with address book access can search and view these imported contacts.
- Imported contacts remain read-only in NethVoice CTI, even when the user has the maximum phonebook permission level.
- Create, edit, delete, and sharing actions in NethVoice CTI apply only to CTI contacts created by users.
- Phonebook permission levels configured in user profiles control what users can do with CTI contacts, not with records imported from external sources. For profile-level details, see [Address Book permissions](../wizard.md#address-book).
- Group sharing of contacts *created in NethVoice CTI* is available only with `Manage private and shared contacts`. The selectable groups come from the user's Presence Panel group permissions and group membership; if the Presence Panel `all_groups` permission is enabled, all operator groups are available.
- Imported contacts have their own visibility, chosen by the administrator on the source itself: see [Sharing options](#sharing-options).

#### Adding External Address Books {#adding-external-address-books}

From the menu `Applications -> Address Book Sources`, you can define an external source for the contacts NethVoice should use to resolve incoming and outgoing calls.
These contacts will be added to the NethVoice address book and made available for use in NethVoice CTI and NethVoice App.

To configure a new source, three steps are required:

- **Source**: Configure access to the source database of contacts.
- **Mapping**: Associate fields from the source database with those of the NethVoice address book.
- **Settings**: Choose who can see the imported contacts and, for recurring sources, the synchronization interval.

#### Phonebook Source {#phonebook-source}

The available `Source Type` values are:

| Source type | Destination | Behaviour |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| `MySQL` | Centralized phonebook | Recurring synchronization from an external database |
| `CSV` | Centralized phonebook | Recurring synchronization from a CSV file |
| `CSV (CTI phonebook)` | Personal address book of a CTI user | One-shot import, no synchronization |
| `Infinity Zucchetti` | Centralized phonebook | Recurring synchronization through the Zucchetti Infinity APIs |

For sources that feed the centralized phonebook, a unique `Phonebook Name` must be assigned to distinguish the origin of the contacts imported into the NethVoice phonebook. The `CSV (CTI phonebook)` source does not require it, since imported contacts belong to a user and not to a centralized source.

Based on the `Source Type`, additional attributes need to be specified:

**MySQL**

Database name, server address/port, username, and password for the source database are required.

Additionally, in the Select query text area, the SQL query used to retrieve data to be imported into the centralized address book must be inserted. If present in the text area, replace the word `[table]` with the name of the source table.

**CSV**

In the `URL` field, you can specify the web address of a file in CSV format (Comma-Separated Values, values separated by commas and double quotes "" as text qualifiers, mandatory if the field contains a comma or space). Addresses starting with `http://` and `https://` are accepted.

Alternatively, you can upload a CSV file via the button to the right of the same text field. In this case, the `URL` field will be automatically populated.

The CSV file must be encoded in UTF-8 and contain column names on the first row.

The `Verify` button allows you to preview the data retrieved from the source.

**CSV (CTI phonebook)**

This source type uses the same CSV file format described above, but the contacts are imported once into the personal address book of a single CTI user instead of the centralized phonebook. No recurring source is stored and no synchronization interval is available.

Two additional settings are required:

- **Owner**: the CTI user the contacts are assigned to. Only configured users (users with an extension) can be selected, and the field is mandatory.
- **Sharing options**: the visibility applied to every imported contact, see [Sharing options](#sharing-options).

The `owner_id` destination field cannot be mapped for CSV sources, because the owner is chosen explicitly.

At the end of the import, the result is reported as the number of `Imported`, `Skipped` and `Failed` rows. Rows without a value in the field mapped to `name` are skipped, and a malformed row does not abort the whole import.

**Infinity Zucchetti**

Populates the centralized phonebook through the [Zucchetti Infinity](../../../tutorial/integrations/zucchetti-integration.md) APIs. Only the API endpoint `URL`, `Username` and `Password` provided by Zucchetti are required: the field mapping is fixed and applied by the importer, so the **Mapping** step only shows it in read-only mode.

| Infinity source field | NethVoice phonebook field |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Name | `name` |
| Company | `company` |
| Mobile phone | `cellphone` |
| Work phone | `workphone` |
| Home phone | `homephone` |
| Fax | `fax` |
| Work email | `workemail` |
| Home email | `homeemail` |
| Address | `workstreet` |
| Office | `title` |
| Office / status / id | `notes` |

#### Sharing options {#sharing-options}

For every source you can choose who can see the imported contacts:

- **Public**: the contacts are visible to all users that can access the address book. This is the default and it matches the behaviour of sources configured before this option was introduced.
- **Groups**: the contacts are visible only to the members of the selected groups. At least one group must be selected.

The selectable groups are the CTI groups configured in `Configurations -> Users`. If none of the selected groups exists any more (for example because it was renamed or deleted), the source is rejected instead of being silently made public.

#### Custom Name Resolution {#custom-name-resolution}

If you wish to use a source other than the centralized address book to resolve names, you can create a custom resolution script and place it in the *~/.local/share/containers/storage/volumes/lookup.d/\_data/* directory.

In the [Github repository](https://github.com/nethesis/ns8-nethvoice/tree/main/freepbx/usr/src/nethvoice/samples), there are two example scripts: *lookup_dummy.php* and *lookup_vte.php*, which can serve as a starting point for creating your own custom script.

The *lookup_dummy.php* script returns a fake result for any number dialed or incoming call, while the lookup_vte.php script utilizes an external API.

| workphone2      | Secondary business telephone number |
| cellphone2      | Secondary mobile number |
| otherphone      | Other telephone number |
| otheremail      | Other email address    |
| facebook        | Facebook profile       |
| instagram       | Instagram profile      |
| linkedin        | LinkedIn profile       |

The `name` field is still the one used for call name resolution: `firstname` and `lastname` are additional fields, shown and editable in NethVoice CTI.

:::note
The source name is no longer a mappable destination field: it is set once in the `Phonebook Name` field of the source.
:::

#### Settings {#settings}

Recurring sources (`MySQL`, `CSV`, `Infinity Zucchetti`) synchronize contacts on a schedule. The `CSV (CTI phonebook)` source is a one-shot import and has no synchronization settings.

You can choose the synchronization interval for contacts between:

- 15 minutes
- 30 minutes
- 1 hour
- 6 hours
- 24 hours

Once the source is created, you can:

- Immediately synchronize using the `Sync` button
- Enable/disable synchronization
