# Applications

The *Applications* section allows for the creation, modification, or deletion of certain PBX features, which are initially created and configured in the wizard but subsequently utilized in the NethVoice CTI.

For instance, customer cards are set up in the wizard to access the database and to practically display the obtained information, but the actual usage occurs within the NethVoice CTI, during calls or when searching for specific information.

## Available Applications {#available-applications}

The following applications are available in the *Applications* section:

- **Customer Cards**: Display information from external databases during calls.
- **Phonebook Sources**: Integrate external address books for contact resolution.
- **Parameterized URLs**: Trigger custom URLs with call-related parameters during call events.
- **Video Sources**: Configure IP cameras and video sources for integration with NethVoice.
- **Bulk actions**: Manage and modify multiple extensions and phones simultaneously.
- **Google TTS/STT**: Integrate Google's Text-To-Speech and Speech-To-Text services for dynamic voice announcements and custom speech recognition.
