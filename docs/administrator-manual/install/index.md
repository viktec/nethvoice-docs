# Installation Guide

This section covers the complete installation process for NethVoice, from setting up the underlying NethServer 8 infrastructure to configuring NethVoice itself.

## Overview {#overview}

NethVoice installation is a multi-step process:

1. **[NethServer 8 Installation](nethserver)** - Install the NethServer 8 base platform
2. **[Create User Domain](nethserver#user-domains)** - Set up LDAP for users and authentication (in NethServer)
3. **[NethVoice Proxy Installation & Configuration](../nethvoice_proxy/)** - Install and configure the external VoIP gateway (REQUIRED first)
4. **[NethVoice Installation](nethvoice_install)** - Install NethVoice on top of configured proxy
5. **[Module Configuration](nethvoice_install#module-configuration)** - Configure NethVoice with your requirements

:::warning Installation Order
1. NethServer 8 must be installed first
2. User Domain must be created second (required by NethVoice)
3. NethVoice Proxy must be installed and configured third
4. NethVoice can only be installed after proxy is ready
5. NethVoice configuration uses the user domain created in step 2

See [NethVoice Proxy Installation](../nethvoice_proxy/) for details on proxy requirements.
