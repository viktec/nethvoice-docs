# NethVoice Administrator Manual

## What is NethVoice?

NethVoice is a comprehensive, unified communications platform built on open-source technologies. It integrates voice, video, and mobile capabilities into a single, powerful PBX system that organizations of any size can deploy and manage.

Unlike traditional proprietary PBX systems, NethVoice combines the flexibility of FreePBX/Asterisk with modern web-based interfaces, WebRTC technology, and advanced provisioning capabilities to deliver enterprise-grade communications.

:::info
This documentation covers the complete installation, configuration, and management of NethVoice on NethServer 8. Whether you're deploying your first system or managing multiple instances, you'll find comprehensive guides for every aspect of NethVoice.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before deploying NethVoice, ensure you have:

- ✅ **System Resources**: Minimum 2 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 40GB storage per instance
- ✅ **Network Requirements**: Static IP, DNS configured, internet connectivity
- ✅ **NethServer 8**: Fully installed and configured (see [Installation Guide](./install/))
- ✅ **User Domain**: Created for users and authentication (see [User Domains in NethServer Installation](./install/nethserver.md#user-domains))
- ✅ **NethVoice Proxy**: Installed and configured with proper FQDN and DNS records (required for any NethVoice deployment)

### Deployment Steps

1. **[Review System Requirements](./install/nethserver#system-requirements)** - Ensure your infrastructure meets requirements
2. **[Install NethServer 8](./install/nethserver/)** - Deploy the base infrastructure platform
3. **[Create User Domain](./install/nethserver.md#user-domains)** - Set up LDAP for users and authentication
4. **[Install & Configure NethVoice Proxy](./advanced/nethvoice_proxy)** - Deploy the external VoIP gateway (REQUIRED before NethVoice)
5. **[Deploy NethVoice](./install/nethvoice_install/)** - Install NethVoice module(s) on top of the proxy
6. **Configure Your System**:
   - [Provision Phones](./provisioning/) - Deploy and configure telephone devices
   - [Manage Extensions](../user-manual/nethcti/) - Create extensions and assign to users
7. **[Advanced Configuration](./advanced/)** - Configure trunks, gateways, routing, and advanced features

| Section | Purpose | Learn About |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **[Installation](./install/)** | System setup and deployment | NethServer, NethVoice installation, prerequisites |
| **[Provisioning](./provisioning/)** | Phone device management | Supported devices, provisioning methods, configuration |

:::tip Multi-Instance Deployments
You can install multiple NethVoice instances on the same NethServer 8 node from the Software Center. Each instance requires separate configuration and runs independently. This is useful for multi-tenant deployments or separate business units.
:::

:::warning Prerequisites
The NethVoice module requires that the **NethVoice proxy** be already installed, configured, and running on the system. 

**Why?** NethVoice Proxy:
- Manages all external VoIP traffic from the internet
- Handles SIP/RTP traffic routing and delegation
- Enables external access even with a single NethVoice instance
- Routes traffic between multiple NethVoice installations on the same node

If you haven't set up the proxy yet, refer to the [NethVoice Proxy documentation](./advanced/nethvoice_proxy) before installing NethVoice.
