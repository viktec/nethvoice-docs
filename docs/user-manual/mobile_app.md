## App Features

### Speed Dial

In the Speed Dial section, you can add or manage your list of favorite contacts to easily monitor their availability. Each added contact displays a status: 

- 🟢 Available – when the contact is not on a call
- 🔴 Ringing – when their phone is ringing
- 🔴 Busy – when the contact is currently on a call

To add a contact to the list, tap “Edit” and then press “+”. You will be asked to enter the Title (Name and Surname), the Phone Number or SIP address (extension), and check the Status, which monitors the extension’s state. You can also add a photo or import the contact directly from your Address Book. Once saved, the contact will appear in the list.


### History

Inside the History section, there are three subsections where you can view all handled, missed, and received calls.
The “Missed” subsection filters incoming calls that were not answered.
The “Recorded” subsection lists all recorded calls; by tapping the “i” information icon, you can access a page where you can listen to the recording. Tapping the “i” again allows you to delete the recording, send it via email, share it with other apps, or lock it to prevent deletion.
In the “All” subsection, using the “Edit” button you can delete all calls or select only the ones you want to remove. Next to “Edit”, there is a button that lets you export all calls by generating a text file containing the call data.


### Keypad

In the “Keypad” section, you can dial a number to make a call, add a new contact, or add the dialed number to an existing contact in the Address Book. At the bottom right, the “Delete” button appears to remove the last digit or the entire number entered.



### Making a Call

Making a call with the NethVoice app is very simple and can be done from the Keypad or from the Contacts section by selecting a desired contact. After dialing the number, tap the green phone icon to start the call.

During the call, the screen displays the following buttons:

* Keypad: to dial numbers during the call.
* Hold: pauses the call so the other party cannot hear you (they will hear hold music).
* Record: allows recording the ongoing call.
* Blind Transfer: transfers the call without speaking to the destination contact.
* Add to Call: adds another internal or external number to create a conference call. During a conference, the “Split” button appears, allowing you to alternate between calls or close one of the two calls.
* Attended Transfer: transfers the call after speaking with the destination contact to obtain consent.

Above these buttons, you will find a bar with the following controls:

* Microphone: mute/unmute your microphone.
* Speaker: enable loudspeaker mode.
* Camera: switch to a video call.


### Contacts

In the Contacts section, you can access both your personal Address Book and the NethVoice directory, where you can add or edit contacts.
To create a new contact, tap “+”, then fill in the First Name, Last Name, Company, phone number, and email.
By selecting an existing contact you can edit it, make a call, or start a video call. You can also set a custom ringtone for the selected contact.


### Videocall

To start a video call, simply select a user in the Contacts section and tap the camera icon. Alternatively, during a voice call, you can switch to a video call by tapping the camera icon.


### Settings

From the Keypad section, tap the gear icon in the top right corner to open Settings, where you can manage:

* Ringtones: set a ringtone different from the default.
* Audio: manage echo settings, speakers, gain, and Bluetooth support.
* Call Recording: enable automatic call recording with options for format and advanced settings.
* Controls: enable headset button control and manage GSM call handling.
* Do Not Disturb: create DND rules to avoid receiving calls during specific periods.
* Contact Sorting: manage how contacts are displayed in the Address Book.
* Information: version info and device details.
* Usage: statistics on call duration and call counts.
* Logs: access diagnostic logs for troubleshooting and problem analysis. You can review or collect logs to assist with support requests.
* Disconnect: sign out of the app without removing its configuration.
* Reset Application: completely reset the app and clear all associated data. To log in again, follow the instructions in the Access section.
