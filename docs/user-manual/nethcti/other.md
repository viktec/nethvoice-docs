Search for contacts quickly and efficiently.

What you can do in the address book depends on your profile permissions:

- Users with `Access phonebook` can search and view contacts, but cannot create or change CTI contacts.
- Users with `Manage private contacts` can create and manage only their own private CTI contacts.

### Creating Contacts {#creating-contacts}

Add new contacts using the "Create Contact" function (subject to specific permissions):

![Create Contact](/img/nethcti/crea_contatto.png)

Depending on the permissions assigned by the administrator, you may be limited to private contacts only, or you may also be allowed to create public contacts and contacts shared with your available groups. If the group-sharing option is not visible, your profile does not include `Manage private and shared contacts` or no groups are available to your user.

You can add:
- Contact first name and last name
- Company and job title
- Phone numbers: extension, work phone, mobile phone, secondary work phone, secondary mobile phone, home phone, other phone, fax

## Voice Transcription and Call Summary {#voice-transcription}

NethVoice can provide two related AI-assisted call features:

- **Live transcription**: text generated while a call is in progress and shown in Phone Island.
- **Post-call content**: transcription and, when enabled, an AI-generated summary available after the call from **History > Calls**.

### Requirements {#transcription-requirements}

Two separate things are required: a per-user permission to **view** the content, and the features **enabled on the system** by an administrator.

- **Permission to view (per user)**: your user profile must include the **Transcription and Summary** permission. It lets you open live transcription during a call and view post-call transcriptions and summaries from History. Without it the transcription and summary controls are not available, even when the feature is enabled on the system.
- **Enabling transcription and summaries (administrator, NethVoice Integrations page)**: an administrator turns the features on from the NethVoice **Integrations** page. Call transcription requires a valid Deepgram API key; AI-generated summaries additionally require an OpenAI API key with the call summary option enabled.

Generated content is available only for calls with usable audio: very short, silent, or failed calls may not produce a transcript or summary.

AI-generated text can contain mistakes. Review important content before copying, sharing, or saving it.

### Supported calls and limitations {#supported-calls}

All calls are supported for transcription and summary; the only exception is **multi-party conferences**, which are not transcribed or summarized.

:::note Privacy
Your privacy is always preserved: you only see the transcriptions and summaries of conversations you took part in, never those of other users.
:::

### Live transcription during calls {#live-transcription-during-calls}

During an active call:

1. Open the Phone Island side actions.
2. Select **Open transcription** when the action is available.
3. The live transcription panel opens and starts receiving text for the current call.
4. Interim text may change until final segments are confirmed.
5. Close the transcription panel to stop live transcription for that call.

Live transcription is for the active call only. Completed-call content is reviewed later from History.

### Post-call transcription and summary {#after-the-call}

After a supported answered call ends, NethVoice processes the available call audio. Processing can take some time, depending on call length and service availability.

When processing is complete, the call can expose:

- **Transcription**: the full post-call transcript, shown read-only.
- **Summary**: an AI-generated summary. The summary can be edited and saved from the drawer.

To review generated content:

1. Open **History > Calls**.
2. Use the content filter when needed: **Summary**, **Transcription**, or **Voicemail**.
3. Open the call actions menu.
4. Select **View summary** when a summary is available, or **View transcription** when only the transcript is available.

When a summary is available, the summary drawer also lets you expand and review the full transcription.

### Summary notifications {#summary-notifications}

When call summary is enabled for your user, CTI can notify you when a summary becomes ready.

From **Settings > Notifications** you can enable or disable **Call summary notifications**. The preference is shared between the web phone and NethLink.

CTI shows an in-app notification when a summary is ready. If browser notifications are allowed and the CTI page is not focused, CTI can also show a system notification. Opening the notification or the in-app action opens the related summary drawer.

## Settings {#settings}

Customize your NethVoice CTI by accessing Settings:

![Settings](/img/nethcti/Impostazioni.png)

1. Ringtone Settings: Choose the sound that plays when an incoming call is received.
2. Ringtone Output Device: Select which audio device will play the ringtone.
3. Parameterized URL: You can configure the system to automatically open a URL whenever an external call comes in. This is useful for CRM lookups, customer information pages, or internal tools.
4. URL Opened on External Incoming Call: The URL is configured by system administrator.
